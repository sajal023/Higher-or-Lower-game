The Higher Lower Game is a simple guessing game where players must decide which of two options has a higher or lower value based on search volume, popularity, or some other metric. Here's how it generally works:

->The game presents two topics or search terms (e.g., celebrities, brands, movies).
->Players must guess if the second option has higher or lower value than the first one.
->The game continues for as long as the player answers correctly. If the player guesses wrong, the game ends, and they are shown their score.

HOW DO I WIN?
To "win" or do well in the Higher Lower Game, the goal is to achieve the highest possible score by correctly guessing whether each subsequent option has a higher or lower value than the previous one. While the game 
doesn’t usually have an official "end" or point where you’re declared a winner, here are some tips to help you maximize your score:

Tips for Winning:
->Familiarize Yourself with Popular Trends: The game is often based on search trends, so knowing what's currently popular in terms of celebrities, brands, events, or cultural moments will help.

->Understand Search Behavior: Some topics might seem less popular but are searched more frequently because they’re related to broader, more universal needs (like weather or health topics).

->Look for Recurring Options: If you’ve played multiple rounds, the same terms might appear again, so remember their search volumes to make better guesses in the future.

->Use Common Sense and Logic: For example, something that’s an ongoing global event (like the Olympics or a natural disaster) will often have higher search volume than something niche or localized.

->Focus on Extreme Terms: Some search terms (e.g., Google, YouTube) have extremely high search volumes compared to others, so if they come up, it’s easier to guess their relationship to lesser-known options.
